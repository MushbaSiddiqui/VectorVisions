                Vector Vision is a provider of custom embroidery digitizing services for badges, uniforms, and apparel. Our business is custom embroidery digitizing, logo designing, graphics & vectorization. We recognize the unique aspects of every design.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Our experienced digitizers manually convert your design into the digitized embroidery file format of your choice. Because we do not scan or "auto-digitize," we are able to adhere to the highest level of quality and capture the unique features of your design.

                This process is carried out by our thoroughly knowledgeable professionals with the help of certain embroidery digitizing software. It requires skilled digitizer's manual input and creative treatments as per the clients requirement which can not be achieved by any auto-digitizing software. In fact, many of our clients sent us auto-digitized file and asked us to re-digitize it.
